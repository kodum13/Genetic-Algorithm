# Genetic-Algorithm
Python code for Genetic Algorithm based on “A Simulation-based decision support for multi-echelon inventory problem with service level constraints” by Shing Chih Tsai and Chung Hung Liu. 

The code will recreate the genetic algorithm used in the paper “A Simulation-based decision support for multi-echelon inventory problem with service level constraints”. The algorithm is used to set the optimal stocking levels of a hypothetical store with the goal of minimizing cost while maintaining product availability. My code will focus on the large sample algorithm portion that creates the solution space, applies a linear ranking scheme, generate future generation solutions including mutations, and converge on a best solution.
